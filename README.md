# Controls & Compliance Checklist — Botium Toys

## Overview
This project is a course artifact from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
My task was to complete a **Controls Assessment** and **Compliance Checklist** for a fictional company scenario (“Botium Toys”)
using the provided scope, goals, and risk assessment information.

## What I completed (My Deliverable)
✅ Completed document:
- `completed/Controls-and-compliance-checklist.docx`

## References used (Course-Provided)
These documents were provided as part of the course scenario and used as reference:
- `provided-course-materials/Botium-Toys-Scope-goals-and-risk-assessment-report.docx`
- `provided-course-materials/Audit-Scope-and-Goals.docx`
- `provided-course-materials/Control-categories.docx`

## How I approached it
1. Reviewed the scenario scope and audit goals (what needs to be assessed).
2. Used the risk assessment details (existing controls + gaps) to mark each control as **Yes/No**.
3. Checked compliance best practices for:
   - PCI DSS
   - GDPR
   - SOC (Type 1/Type 2 concepts)
4. Summarized priorities based on risk (controls missing = higher priority).

## Key takeaways (What I learned)
- How to classify controls (Administrative, Technical, Physical) and control types (Preventive/Detective/Corrective/Deterrent)
- How missing controls increase risk (e.g., lack of IDS, backups/DR, encryption, strong password policy enforcement)
- How compliance requirements (PCI DSS / GDPR) influence security recommendations
